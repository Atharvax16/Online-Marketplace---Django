This is the Databse of the Project 
we created databse over here 
**Models = Database blueprint**

Django never touches the database automatically
We created a category model and Because Django models represent database tables, and makemigrations converts model changes into database instructions
We did: **python manage.py makemigrations**
whichi means database is created and after that we did
**python manage.py migrate**
It applies them to the database
